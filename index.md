JavaScript is a object orientated and dynamically typed programming language that has been in use since the 90's. JavaScript has many uses, included but not limited to:

- Website Creation (Client side code)
- Server side code
- Game Creation

The majority of the websites on the internet are made in JavaScript (over 98%!).

When JavaScript is used on the client side of a website, it is typically used with HTML (creates elements on webpage) and CSS (changes how the elements look). JavaScript that is used on the client side typically deals with user interaction. Most programers don't consider HTML and CSS to be programming languages, but they are still very important for websites to have.
