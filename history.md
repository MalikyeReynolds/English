##### 1995: The Creation of JavaScript

JavaScript was created in 1995 in just 10 days. It was made by Brendan Eich and implemented in Netscape Navigator, one of the first web browsers. Although it was only able to load static pages, its simplicity made it loved by the public.

##### 1995: The Creation of Internet Explorer

Later in the same year that it was created, Internet Explorer was created by Microsoft. Both Netscape and Internet Explorer used JavaScript, but they had different interpreters. Because of the difference in their interpreters, something that workd on Internet Explorer wasn't guarenteed to work on something else and vise versa. They even had different versions of logos and webpages for specific web browsers.

##### 1997: The Creation of EMCAScript

EMCAScript was created to help different browsers run the same code. This would help the web developers with efficency and the users with ease of use.

##### 2008: The Release of HTML5

In 2008 HTML5 was realeased. This added many useful features to HTML, and even allowed people to make games using an HTML5 canvas!

##### 2009: The Creation of Node.JS

Node.JS was created in 2009. Its purpose is to help people easily write server side code in JavaScript. With this, people could easily make servers and connect their users with their own JavaScript.

##### 2012: Release of TypeScript

TypeScript was created in 2012 by Microsoft to help fix the shortcomings of JavaScript. TypeScript is like JavaScript, but there is more rules and syntax. This is very helpful because JavaScript doesn't have as many rules as other programming languages, making it more flexible but also more prone to errors and bugs. TypeScript was made because Microsoft couldn't change their JavaScript for compatability reasons (EMCAScript). Even today, many developers prefer TypeScript over JavaScript, because it is easier to find bugs and has to be typed following rules, making code more readable.


###### Notes: 

There were many big things that have happened to JavaScript, most of which aren't here. Just because something wasn't here doens't mean that it was less important then anything else here.
