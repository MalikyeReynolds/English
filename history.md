##### 1995: The Creation of JavaScript

JavaScript was created in 1995 in just 10 days. It was made by Brendan Eich and implemented in Netscape Navigator, one of the first web browsers. Although it was only able to load static pages, its simplicity made it loved by the public.

##### 1995: The Creation of Internet Explorer

Later in the same year that it was created, Internet Explorer was created by Microsoft. Both Netscape and Internet Explorer used JavaScript, but they had different interpreters. Because of the difference in their interpreters, something that workd on Internet Explorer wasn't guarenteed to work on something else and vise versa. They even had different versions of logos and webpages for specific web browsers.
