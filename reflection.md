subtitle: What I did to make this website and what I should improve in the future
---

&emsp; Everyone has their own strengths. Some people are more creative, and others are better at more practical things, like making websites. I am good at neither. I thought that it would be a good learning experience to make a website, to practice both my website building and creative skills. My strengths are my problem solving and my ability to program, so even if I don’t know how to do something exactly, I am able to fix any problems that I may have. This was definitely a learning experience, and I have learned a lot of things about websites. I also have learned what I should improve and what I should do differently next time I approach any project that I plan to face. 

&emsp; My initial goals for this project were to create an easy-to-traverse website that isn’t too difficult to understand. Although I feel like I did accomplish that, I feel like some of the terms that I used I did not define well enough. What I could have and should do next time is go over terms that only certain people would know. I was not going for a website where you had to know how to program, yet I feel like some of the topics I talked about you had to know programming to understand. However, I understand that it would be very difficult to explain such a topic to people that do not understand anything about it, so I am not very upset about how it turned out. 

&emsp; I mostly wrote this website in the confines of my room. Although I might have been able to write this website more creatively if I were elsewhere, I feel like it might have just made things more difficult. Because I was somewhere that I was comfortable and with the help of people online and other sources, I was able to produce a pretty good website.

&emsp; I definitely should have spread out the work for creating this website more. I feel like it could have been much better, however I got distracted and started making that game that I used as an example. I mean, it is an okay game that shows the use of JavaScript, but that time could have gone somewhere else. 

&emsp; When I first started making the website, I started doubting myself because I had done no research on how to make a website. Yeah sure, I have experience in JavaScript. However, I don’t really have any experience in making an actual website that I need to host and create. I feel like this was a pretty good learning experience, but I also feel like I should have done more research before trying to start this project.

&emsp; In conclusion, there are many things that I need to think about for my next project. I need to make sure that what I write is understandable, that I am writing it in a comfortable place, and that I need to spread out my work more and not get distracted. It's okay to make mistakes, because if done correctly it can be used as a learning experience. There is always a way to improve and do better, and everyone should always strive to do their best. I enjoyed making this website, even if I didn’t do the best that could have been done, and that's all that really matters. No work is done in vain if there is experience to be learned from it.
